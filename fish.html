        Fish represent a broad class of aquatic animals that can live in fresh
        or saltwater, depending on the species. Bringing fish into your home
        can be an exciting hobby, especially if you intend to breed them, and
        the presence of a fish tank in your home can induce feelings of peace
        and tranquility. Whether you are bringing your fish home for the first
        time or maintaining your aquarium, it is important to test your water
        once per week to ensure it is free from toxins that can harm your fish.

              <li>pH Level: 6.8–7.6 (7.0 is considered neutral)</li>
              <li>Ammonia: any level above zero is harmful to fish</li>
              <li>Nitrates: 5 to 10ppm</li>
              <li>Nitrites: less than 0.5 ppm</li>
